**# JavaScript-Projects**

This repository contains all the coding projects and assignments from my JavaScript course. As I progress through the course, I will be adding assignments, challenges, and any other relevant coding work. This serves as a central location for all my work related to the course, making it easy to track my learning journey and showcase my skills.
